Hey there, I'm Dominic aka Splines and I love science & coding. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science (worked at SAP) and am currently doing my second Bachelor's degree in physics at Heidelberg University.


### Coding

Most of what I code is open-source. I feel comfortable in these programming languages (but am happy to adapt to others as I seem fit).

- **Ruby on Rails** for the backend of web apps like [MaMpf](https://github.com/mampf-hd/mampf). **HTML, SCSS & JS** for front-end. I love [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) and [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/). We also use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- **TypeScript with Node.js** to [animate](https://github.com/Splines/phonetics-graph/blob/main/phonetics-motion-canvas/src/scenes/alignment.tsx) videos for my [Splience YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@splience). I use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and the amazing [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) to do so. I also use TypeScript to program the [manim-notebook](https://github.com/Manim-Notebook/manim-notebook) VSCode extension.
- **Python** for various projects like a [Captive Portal on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Splines/raspi-captive-portal). But also for (mostly private) data science projects. And for machine learning with PyTorch in the [Scientific AI group](https://sciai-lab.org/).
- **Rust** (and partially **C++**) for performance-intensive tasks like [parallelizing](https://github.com/Splines/phonetics-graph) the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm on an GPU. I've also written a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01654) about it. Also used Rust to implement a fast version of the [Louvain algorithm](https://github.com/splines/fast-louvain).
- For typesetting, I used LaTeX for a long time am now slowly switching to [Typst](https://typst.app/).
