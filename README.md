Hey there, I'm Dominic aka Splines and I love science & coding. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science (worked at SAP) and am currently doing my second Bachelor's degree in physics at Heidelberg University.

### Coding

Most of what I code is open-source. See also my [blog](https://splines.me) for some technical write-ups. I feel comfortable in these programming languages (but am happy to adapt to others as I seem fit):

- Full-stack: **Ruby on Rails** for the backend of web apps like [MaMpf](https://github.com/mampf-hd/mampf). **HTML, SCSS & JS** for front-end. I love [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) and [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/). We also use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I like to keep things simple and design features from a user's point of view.
- **TypeScript with Node.js** to [animate](https://github.com/Splines/phonetics-graph/blob/main/phonetics-motion-canvas/src/scenes/alignment.tsx) videos for my [Splience YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@splience). I use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and the amazing [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) to do so. I also employ TypeScript to program the [manim-notebook](https://github.com/Manim-Notebook/manim-notebook) VSCode extension.
- **Python** for various projects like a [Captive Portal on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Splines/raspi-captive-portal). But also for (mostly private) data science projects (e.g. analysis of Nextbike rides). Python is also the main programming language in the [Scientific AI group](https://sciai-lab.org/), where we apply graph machine learning (PyTorch) for Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT).
- **Rust** (and partially **C++**) for performance-intensive tasks like [parallelizing](https://github.com/Splines/phonetics-graph) the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm on a GPU (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01654)). Also used Rust to implement a fast version of the [Louvain algorithm](https://github.com/splines/fast-louvain).
- For typesetting, I used LaTeX for quite some time and am now slowly switching to [Typst](https://typst.app/).
